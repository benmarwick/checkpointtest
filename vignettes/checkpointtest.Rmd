We choose a checkpoint date for an earlier version of MASS than the current version (‘7.3.45’). Then we have a package test that checks to see if the version of MASS used here is the earlier version and not the current version.

```{r checkpointsetup, eval = FALSE}
# This will scan the Rmd file to identify the packages used within, and 
# get the source of the package and store it locally. In order to knit this doc, I had to install.packages("rmarkdown", repos = "https://cran.revolutionanalytics.com")
library(checkpoint)
checkpoint("2015-01-10", 
           auto.install.knitr = TRUE,
           use.knitr = TRUE, 
           checkpointLocation = "../packages")
```

```{r dothings}

```{r checkopts}

# check libsS

# check pkgs
installed.packages()[, "Package"]
